plato was created to provide an efficient and standardised workflow to analyse the motions of tectonic plates using the torque balance expected from their reconstructed geometries.

This package leverages GPlately to interrogate quantitative plate reconstructions built using GPlates. GPlates is open-source application software offering a novel combination of interactive plate-tectonic reconstructions, geographic information system functionality and raster data visualisation.

The package is based on the algorithm initially published by [Clennett et al. (2023)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-37117-w)
